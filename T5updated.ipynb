Your Consumer Rights and How to Exercise Them https://epson.com/privacy-policy 56/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US As described more below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below), Epson provides Consumers the privacy rights described in this section. For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion with respect to how we process such requests. We will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion. To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, use our Consumer Rights Request Portal, or call us at 1-800-822-0313, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). More details on the request and verification process is in Section g below. The Consumer rights we accommodate, subject to your state law, are as follows: a. Right to Limit Sensitive PI Processing With regard to PI that qualifies as Sensitive PI under U.S. Privacy Laws, as of January 1, 2023, if you elect to provide us with that Sensitive PI you will have consented to such Processing. However, California Personnel can limit certain Sensitive PI Processing and if you choose to do so we will explain in a response what Processing purposes U.S. Privacy Laws do not allow you to limit. b. Right to Know/Access Residents of California, Virginia, and Colorado are entitled to access their PI up to twice in a 12-month period. Residents of Connecticut and Utah are entitled once every 12-month period to access their PI maintained by Epson, with subsequent requests subject to a service fee. To the extent we permit consumers to exercise rights where their states of residence do not include such rights under applicable state https://epson.com/privacy-policy 57/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US law, we apply the same limitation on number of Verifiable Consumer Requests in Connecticut and Utah to all states other than California, Virginia, and Colorado. 1. Categories (available for California Residents Only) California residents have a right to submit a request for any of the following for the period that is 12-months prior to the request date: The categories of PI we have Collected about you. The categories of sources from which we Collected your PI. The Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes for our Collecting, Selling, or Sharing your PI. The categories of Third Parties to whom we have disclosed your PI. A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a Business Purpose and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred. A list of the categories of PI Sold or Share about you and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no Sale or Share occurred. 2. Specific Pieces You may request to confirm if we are Processing your PI and, if we are, to obtain a transportable copy, subject to applicable request limits, of your PI that we have collected and are maintaining. For your specific pieces of PI, as required by applicable U.S. Privacy Laws, we will apply the heightened verification standards as described below. https://epson.com/privacy-policy 58/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US We have no obligation to re-identify information or to keep PI longer than we need it or are required to by applicable law to comply with access requests. c. Do Not Sell / Share / Target Under the various U.S. Privacy Laws there are broad and differing concepts of “Selling” PI for which an opt-out is required. California also has an opt-out from “Sharing” for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising (use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements). Other states have an opt-out of “Targeted Advertising” (defined differently but also addressing tracking, profiling, and targeting of advertisements). We may Sell or Share your PI and/or use your PI for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S. Privacy Laws. However, we provide U.S. Consumers, and in some cases their authorized agents, an opt out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting that is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out available regardless of state of residency. You can opt-out by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link in our Site footer or by going here. Third-Party digital businesses (“Third-Party Digital Businesses”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that Collect PI about you on our services, or otherwise Collect and Process PI that we make available about you, including digital activity information. We understand that giving access to PI on our Services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Share under some state laws and thus we will treat such PI (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online identifiers, and internet or other electronic activity information) collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses, where not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor), as a Sale and/or Share and subject to a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request. We will not Sell your PI, Share https://epson.com/privacy-policy 59/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US your PI for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising, or Process your PI for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt- out request. Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here. Opt-out for cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie “consent manager” tool here. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie PI and to non-cookie PI. Our consent manager enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our consent manager. Note that if you use ad blocking software, our consent manager may not appear when you visit our Services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool. Opt-out preference signals (also known as global privacy control or “GPC”): Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in California as opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal information. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. We https://epson.com/privacy-policy 60/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US have configured the settings of our consent manager to receive and process GPC signals on our Sites for visitors with IP Address indicating they are from a state where this is required. We process OOPS/GPC with respect to Sales and Sharing that may occur in the context of Collection of cookie PI by tracking technologies online by Third-Party Digital Businesses, discussed above, and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We currently do not, due to technical limitations, process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of Sales and Sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie PI). We do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our Service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC. We do not knowingly Sell or Share the PI of Consumers under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years old, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer who is less than 13 years old. If you think we may have unknowingly collected PI of a Consumer under 16 years old, please Contact Us. We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale or Share: (i) if you direct us to disclose PI; (ii) to comply with a Consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Epson as defined above, or as part of a Corporate Transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. d. Right to Delete Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under applicable law, you may request that we delete your PI. Our retention rights include, without limitation: https://epson.com/privacy-policy 61/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US to complete transactions and services you have requested; for security purposes; for legitimate internal Business Purposes (e.g., maintaining business records); to comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement; and to exercise or defend legal claims. Please also be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of PI or content you may have posted. Note also that, depending on where you reside (e.g., California and Utah), we may not be required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you. e. Correct Your PI Consumers may bring inaccuracies they find in their PI that we maintain to our attention, and we will act upon such a request as required by applicable law. You can also make changes to your online account in the account settings section of the account. That will not, however, change your information that exists in other places. f. Automated Decision Making/Profiling and Limit Processing of Sensitive PI https://epson.com/privacy-policy 62/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US We do not engage in Automated Decision Making or Profiling or Process Sensitive PI in a manner that is subject to a limitation request. g. How to Exercise Your Consumer Privacy Rights To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, use our Consumer Rights Request Portal, or call us at 1-800-822-0313, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). 1. Your Request Must be a Verifiable Consumer Request As permitted or required by applicable U.S. Privacy Laws, any request you submit to us must be a Verifiable Consumer Request, meaning when you make a request, we may ask you to provide verifying information, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number and/or account information. We will review the information provided and may request additional information (e.g., transaction history) via e-mail or other means to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. We do not verify opt-outs of Sell/Share/Target requests unless we suspect fraud. We verify each request as follows: Right to Know (Categories) (available for California residents only): If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request https://epson.com/privacy-policy 63/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US to Know Categories of PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. If we cannot do so, we will refer you to this Notice for a general description of our data practices. Right to Know (Specific Pieces): If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Know Specific Pieces of PI to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. If you fail to provide requested information, we will be unable to verify you sufficiently to honor your request, but we will then treat it as a Right to Know Categories Request if you are a California resident. Do Not Sell/Share/Target: No specific verification required unless we suspect fraud. Right to Delete: If you do not have a password- protected account, we verify your Request to Delete to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion. If we cannot verify you sufficiently to honor a deletion https://epson.com/privacy-policy 64/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US request, you can still make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request. Correction: If you do not have a password-protected account, we verify your Request to Correct PI to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, or to a reasonably high degree of certainty, which may include matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, depending on the sensitivity of the PI and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized correction. To protect Consumers, if we are unable to verify you sufficiently, we will be unable to honor your request. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose. 2. Authorized Agent Requests You may use an authorized agent to make a request for you, subject to our verification of the agent, the agent’s authority to submit requests on your behalf, and of your identity directly from you. You can learn how to do this by visiting the agent section of our Consumer Rights Request Portal. Once your agent’s authority is confirmed, they may exercise rights on your behalf subject to the agency requirements of applicable U.S. Privacy Laws. If we are unable to verify your identity, to help protect your privacy and maintain the security of your information, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request, you may appeal the decision, in which case we will provide you with information about the appeals process. https://epson.com/privacy-policy 65/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US 3. Appeals You may appeal Epson’s decision regarding a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights by sending us an e-mail at epson.privacy@ea.epson.com and responding to any follow-up inquiries or requests we make. h. Our Responses Some PI that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a Consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that PI in response to Consumer requests. If we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reason in our response. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Process to respond to your Consumer request(s). In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request. Consistent with applicable U.S. Privacy Laws and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your Social Security number, driver’s license number, or other government-issued ID https://epson.com/privacy-policy 66/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, in response to a Consumer privacy rights request. Back to Top 3. Non-Discrimination/non-retaliation We will not discriminate or retaliate against you in a manner prohibited by applicable U.S. Privacy Laws for your exercise of your Consumer privacy rights. Back to Top 4. Notice of Financial Incentive Programs We may offer discounts or other rewards (“Incentives”) from time-to- time to Consumers that provide us with PI, such as name, phone number, e-mail address, IP address, or location. You may opt-in to Incentives by subscribing to the applicable program or other loyalty and Incentive programs we may offer from time-to-time (“Program(s)”). Each Program may have additional terms, available on the Program page or at Program sign-up. The Incentives will be described in the Program page, or at Program sign-up. If you subsequently wish to withdraw from the Programs, the method for doing so will be explained in the Program terms. We do not limit Program participation to consumers that do not exercise their CCPA rights. However, a deletion request will not delete Program PI because it is necessary to maintain your participation in the Program. If you desire to delete Program PI, terminate your participation in the Program before making a CCPA deletion request.

Our Rights and the Rights of Others Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use, and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your rights under U.S. Privacy Laws. In addition, we are not required to honor your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or another person’s or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law. Back to Top 6. Additional Notices for California Residents In addition to the CCPA, certain Californians are entitled to certain other notices, as follows: a. California Minors Although our services are intended for an audience over the age of majority, any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use our services, and posted content on the service, can request removal by contacting us, emailing us at contentremoval@ea.epson.com with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject line, and detailing where the content is posted and attesting you posted it. We will then make reasonable, good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines we do not control. b. Shine the Light https://epson.com/privacy-policy 68/71 3/31/24, 10:42 AM Privacy Policy | Epson US We do not disclose “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, to third parties for such third parties own direct marketing purposes without consent. California residents may confirm this by contacting us at epson.privacy@ea.epson.com or Epson America, Inc., 3131 Katella Avenue, Los Alamitos, CA 90720 (Attn: Privacy Coordinator). You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is different than, and in addition to, CCPA rights, and must be requested separately.
