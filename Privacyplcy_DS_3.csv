Slack,"How We Share and Disclose Information This section describes how Slack may share and disclose Information, as described in the section entitled 'Information We Collect and Receive' above. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information to third parties. Slack does not control how a Customer or any third party chooses to share or disclose Information.  The Customer’s Instructions. Slack may share and disclose Information in accordance with a Customer’s instructions and with appropriate consent, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and the Customer’s use of Services functionality and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. Some sharing at a Customer’s request may incur additional fees. To enable Slack to follow our Customers’ instructions, Slack provides several administrator controls to allow Customers to manage their Workspaces. For example, we follow our Customers’ instructions to enable or disable Authorized Users use of various features of the Services, such as Clips or Slack Huddles, channel posting permissions, the sharing and visibility of direct messages including files, or whether and how Authorized Users can connect with other organizations’ Workspaces through Slack Connect. We also follow Customer and Authorized User instructions on how an Authorized User’s profile may be displayed within a Customer’s Workspace or when shared through Slack Connect or other features. Customers may also provide their Authorized Users with the ability to adjust the audience and visibility of certain Customer Data. To learn more, visit our Help Center to understand what choices and settings are available. Displaying the Services. When an Authorized User submits Information, it may be displayed or discoverable to other Authorized Users in the same or connected Workspaces or Slack Connect instances. For example, an Authorized User’s email address may be displayed with their Workspace profile, or other profile and organizational information may be displayed to Authorized Users. Please consult the Help Center for more information on Services functionality. Collaborating with Others. The Services provide different ways for Authorized Users working in independent Workspaces to collaborate, such as Slack Connect or email interoperability. Information, such as an Authorized User’s profile and organizational information, may be shared, subject to the policies and practices of the Workspace(s) you use. For example, depending on the settings of your Workspace, to enable connections with other Authorized Users, your profile may be shared or searchable or discoverable by Authorized Users or other users outside of Workspace(s) you belong to, or shared via email when you invite an Authorized User or other user to collaborate via Slack Connect. In many instances, Slack includes either administrator controls or user controls, depending on the use case, with respect to external collaboration. Authorized Users may also decide to expand the visibility of certain content and Customer Data, such as files. Customer access. Owners, administrators, Authorized Users, and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify, or restrict access to Information. This may include, for example, your employer using features of the Services to access or modify your profile details, or to export logs of Workspace activity. For information about your Workspace settings, please visit https://slack.com/account/settings. Third-Party service providers and partners. We may engage third-party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process Information and support our business.
